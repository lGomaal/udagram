# Creating database

### Here we create database server using AWS RDS service:

1. Open your aws console page and search for RDS service.
1. Create New database server with filling the form.

### After creating your database server you should now have something that looks like that:

![Creating database pics](./imgs/db2.png 'figure 2')

### After that you need to create a new database for your project to run on the newly database server that you have created to be added later on in the enviroment variables.
